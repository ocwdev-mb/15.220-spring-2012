This subject draws on a mix of time-tested, current and forward-looking materials. The frameworks and models for the subject are drawn from various authors including Bartlett & Ghoshal; Doz, Santos & Williamson; Ghemawat; Johanson & Vhalne; Lessard; and Porter. We selected a set of case studies of companies from different origins, different industries, and different ages. These are well-known companies and industries, and this should allow us to focus on their internationalization, global strategy and organization. Other companies will be used as examples during class sessions.

3.  What would you pick as the best exemplar of a "global product"? Why?
4.  Silicon Valley was the "global hotspot" of semiconductors. Is that still the case? Why?
